Define the following classes:

Explosion:

Inherits from both GameEntity and Effect.
Contains a parameterized constructor that takes an x , y position argument and sets the type character to 'E' for Explosion.
Implements the apply() function in a way that modifies a GameEntity object. The method sets the position to (-1, -1) and the type to 'X'.
Ship:

Inherits from GameEntity.
Contains a move(int dx, int dy) function that changes the ship's position.
Has a parameterized constructor that takes an x , y position argument and sets the type character to 'S' for Ship.
Mine:

Inherits from GameEntity.
Contains an explode() function that returns an Explosion object. The Mine type should change to 'X' after exploding.
Has a parameterized constructor that takes an x , y position argument and sets the type character to 'M' for Mine.
In main-2.cpp, create Ship and Mine objects and call their functions. Then, create an Explosion object and call apply() on a Ship object.
